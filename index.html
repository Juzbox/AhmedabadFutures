                <h3 class="title">WHAT MIGHT A SUSTAINABLE AHMEDABAD LOOK LIKE?</h3>
                <p>Over the course of 5 days the industrial design students of <a href="https://anu.edu.in/">Anant National University</a> were challenged to explore what sustainability meant to them and how a strengthened commitment to sustainable practices by those shaping the city of Ahmedabad might inform its development.</p>
                <p>The aim of the workshop was to encourage students to unpack the large and complex concepts of sustainability and foresight, and make these approaches relevant to their own needs and interrogations.</p>
                <p>This was done through a wide range of activities from simple desk research, to world-building, to 3D modelling. Each activity and tool contributed to making these concepts more approachable and personal.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Who shapes our futures?</h3>
                <p>Discussions around the future(s) are evolving, the students were challenged to try and go beyond Euro and techno-centric futures and draw from the city's histories to give a richer, more nuanced take on their narrative. </p>

                <p>We then spent a full day reframing and unpacking what sustainability meant to the students using as a starting point Tony Fry's definition: "Sustain-ability [...] is ‘the ability to sustain.’ That is to say the ability to constantly learn, work on, and improve that which is vital."</p>

                <p>The students mixed research and fiction to arrive at a vision of Ahmedabad that was unique to them. The experience also resulted in the emergence of new questions on sustainable practices, setting them off on their respective learning journeys.</p>

                <p>Each group of students was given one neighborhood in Ahmedabad to ground their investigations in.
